## ðŸ§  Project Motivation

This notebook was created as part of my journey to learn **Python for data analysis**.

The goal was to:

- Practice working with real-time data using APIs
- Clean and structure time series data with Pandas
- Apply basic financial analytics like **daily returns** and **price normalization**
- Visualize insights using Matplotlib

I chose cryptocurrency data because it's dynamic, real-world, and well-documented via the CoinGecko API. This project is a stepping stone toward mastering more advanced Python-based data analysis and visualization workflows, especially in finance and later in geospatial analytics (GIS).

# Crypto Price Analysis â€“ Bitcoin vs Ethereum

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes and compares the price trends of **Bitcoin** and **Ethereum** over the past 30 days, using live data from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation).

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Requests
- CoinGecko API

## ðŸ“Š What this notebook does

- Fetches historical BTC and ETH price data via API
- Normalizes both time series to compare relative changes
- Calculates and plots **daily percentage returns**
- Visualizes both absolute and normalized price trends
